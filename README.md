## Source Tips
Andvaranaut:
* compiles cleanly with any ISO C99 / C++98 compliant compiler.
* builds very quickly (6.23 seconds on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz).
* uses a software graphics engine built on SDL2 to aid cross system portability.
* groups source and header files by typedef.
