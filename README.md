## Source Tips
* A function's first argument type specifies which file its from.
* No global state (unless static local variables are counted).
* Compiles cleanly with any ISO C99 / C++98 compliant compiler.
* Builds very quickly with link time optimization (6.23 seconds on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz).
* Cross system portability is aided by only using SDL2 libraries.

## Notice

Andvaranaut will always be free. Enjoy, and please feel free to contribute, be it this repo or your own fork!
