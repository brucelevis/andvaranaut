# Source Hints
Andvaranaut compiles cleanly with many ISO C99 / C++98 compliant compilers across multiple platforms.

Andvaranaut builds very quickly (6.23 seconds on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz).

Andvaranaut uses a software graphics engine built on SDL2 to aid cross system portability.
